Project Description — “Dineth Portfolio Website”

Project name: Dineth — Portfolio Website
Built with: HTML5, CSS3
Designed in: Figma

Overview

This is my first web project, designed in Figma and developed using HTML and CSS. The website represents my personal portfolio — including my introduction, work, and contact details. It’s a clean and simple design focused on learning web structure, design conversion, and layout building.

Right now, the site is static (not yet responsive), but I plan to add responsive design features in future updates to make it look great on all devices.

 Key Features

Converted from a Figma design to HTML & CSS.

Clean and modern layout following the Figma color and typography style.

Well-organized structure with header, navbar, main content, and footer.

Buttons styled with rounded corners (20px radius) and no underlines for anchor links.

Proper file and folder structure for easy editing and updates.

Beginner-friendly design — built to improve front-end skills.
